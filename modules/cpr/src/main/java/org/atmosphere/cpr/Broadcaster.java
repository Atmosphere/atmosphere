/**
 * A Broadcaster is responsible for delivering messages to its subscribed
 * {@link AtmosphereResource<?,?>}, which are representing a suspended response.
 * {@link AtmosphereResource<?,?>} can be added using {@link Broadcaster#addAtmosphereResource},
 * so when {@link #broadcast(java.lang.Object)} execute,
 * {@link AtmosphereHandler#onStateChange(org.atmosphere.cpr.AtmosphereResourceEvent)} will
 * be invoked and the suspended connection will have a chance to write the
 * message available using {@link AtmosphereResourceEvent#getMessage()}
 * <br>
 * A {@link Broadcaster}, by default, will use an {@link ExecutorService}, and the
 * number of Thread will be computed based on the core/cpu of the OS under
 * which the application run. Thus invoking {@link org.atmosphere.cpr.Broadcaster#broadcast(Object)} will be executed
 * <strong>asynchronously</strong> so this is important to wait for the {@link Future#get} to awake/unblock to be garantee
 * the  operation has completed.
 * <br>
 * One final word on Broadcaster: by default, a Broadcaster will broadcast using
 * all {@link AtmosphereResource<?,?>} on which the response has been suspended, e.g. {AtmosphereResource<?,?>#suspend()}
 * has been invoked. This behavior is configurable and you can configure it by invoking the
 * {@link Broadcaster#setScope(org.atmosphere.cpr.Broadcaster.SCOPE)} ):<ul>
 * <li>REQUEST: broadcast events only to the AtmosphereResourceEvent associated with the current request.</li>
 * <li>APPLICATION: broadcast events to all AtmosphereResourceEvent created for the current web application.</li>
 * <li>VM: broadcast events to all AtmosphereResourceEvent created inside the current virtual machine.</li>
 * </ul>
