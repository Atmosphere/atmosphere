/**
 * A {@link PerRequestBroadcastFilter} implementation that add the expected length of the message. This is
 * useful when used with the atmosphere.js library as the library will read the expected size and wait for the
 * entire messages to be received before invoking its associated callback.
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: The broadcasted message MUST BE a String. If your application is broadcasting another object, you need to
 * write your own Filter.
 * <p/>
 * If you aren't using atmosphere.js, you need to add the {@link org.atmosphere.cpr.HeaderConfig#X_ATMOSPHERE_TRACKMESSAGESIZE} header in order to
 * enable that Filter. The delimiter character used is '|'.
 * <p/>
 * For example, broadcasting String 'helloword' will be received by the client as '9|helloword' but delivered as 'helloword'
 * to the Javascript function/callback.
