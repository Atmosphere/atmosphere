            <h3 id="Satellite">Atmosphere Satellite</h3>
            Applications using Satellite gain the following superpowers:
            <ul>
                <li>Elastic Scalability (just add more servers and they cluster automagically, i.e. automatically)</li>
                <li>Super Speeds (in memory transaction speeds)</li>
                <li>High Availability</li>
                <li>Fault Tolerance</li>
                <li>Cloud Readiness</li>
                <li>100% State Replication</li>
            </ul>
            Satellite is easily able to handle this type of use case with in-memory performance, linear scalability as
            you
            add new nodes and reliability. Satellite is small and gets transparently enabled by Atmosphere.
            Because of its design approach as well as Satellite’s ability to automatically discover and cluster with
            peers,
            Satellite provides drop-in session clustering ability for any Atmosphere enabled server.
            It requires no additional investment in hardware and elastically scales as you add app servers.

            This is a great way to ensure that Atmosphere's session state is maintained when you are clustering
            Atmosphere servers.

            <h3 id="PostMan">Atmosphere Postman</h3>
            With Guaranteed Delivery, the Atmosphere Postman system uses a built-in data store to persist messages.
            Atmosphere Postman guarantees the client that when sending a message, the message will always be delivered
            to the server. In case of a failure, the message will be re-sent until it reaches the server. Postman
            guarantee client's messages delivery.
            <p/>

            <p/>
            When combined with Atmosphere Satellite, when a websocket or fallback transport delivers a message,
            the send operation does not complete successfully until the message is safely stored in the sender’s data
            store. Subsequently, the message is not deleted from one data store until it is successfully forwarded to
            and stored in the next data store. As a result, once a websocket or fallback transport successfully sends a
            message, it is also stored in memory on at least one Atmosphere Satellite until the message has been
            successfully delivered and acknowledged by the browser. Installing Satellite and Postman guarantee 100%
            messages delivery, both from the browser and the server.
            <p/>
            <p/>
            Postman also contains mechanisms for fixing browsers' specific errors. For example, Firefox can leaks
            websockets connections when pages are fastly reloaded. Under that circumstance, a server may die because of
            those phantoms websockets, who create a memory leak. Postman ships with a mechanism to detect that situation
            and automatically get rid of phantoms websockets.
