/**
 * Continuation.
 * 
 * A continuation is a mechanism by which a HTTP Request can be suspended and
 * restarted after a timeout or an asynchronous event has occurred.
 * <p>
 * The continuation mechanism is a portable mechanism that will work 
 * asynchronously without additional configuration of all jetty-7, 
 * jetty-8 and Servlet 3.0 containers.   With the addition of 
 * the {@link ContinuationFilter}, the mechanism will also work
 * asynchronously on jetty-6 and non-asynchronously on any 
 * servlet 2.5 container.
 * <p>
 * The Continuation API is a simplification of the richer async API
 * provided by the servlet-3.0 and an enhancement of the continuation
 * API that was introduced with jetty-6. 
 * </p>
 * <h1>Continuation Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * A continuation object is obtained for a request by calling the 
 * factory method {@link ContinuationSupport#getContinuation(ServletRequest)}.
 * The continuation type returned will depend on the servlet container
 * being used.
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * There are two distinct style of operation of the continuation API.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Suspend/Resume Usage</h3> 
 * <p>The suspend/resume style is used when a servlet and/or
 * filter is used to generate the response after a asynchronous wait that is
 * terminated by an asynchronous handler.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * <b>Filter/Servlet:</b>
 *   // if we need to get asynchronous results
 *   Object results = request.getAttribute("results);
 *   if (results==null)
 *   {
 *     Continuation continuation = ContinuationSupport.getContinuation(request);
 *     continuation.suspend();
 *     myAsyncHandler.register(continuation);
 *     return; // or continuation.undispatch();
 *   }
 * 
 * async wait ...
 * 
 * <b>Async Handler:</b>
 *   // when the waited for event happens
 *   continuation.setAttribute("results",event);
 *   continuation.resume();
 *   
 * <b>Filter/Servlet:</b>
 *   // when the request is redispatched 
 *   if (results==null)
 *   {
 *     ... // see above
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *     response.getOutputStream().write(process(results));
 *   }
 * </pre> 
 * <h3>Suspend/Complete Usage</h3> 
 * <p>
 * The suspend/complete style is used when an asynchronous handler is used to 
 * generate the response:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * <b>Filter/Servlet:</b>
 *   // when we want to enter asynchronous mode
 *   Continuation continuation = ContinuationSupport.getContinuation(request);
 *   continuation.suspend(response); // response may be wrapped
 *   myAsyncHandler.register(continuation);
 *   return; // or continuation.undispatch();
 *
 * <b>Wrapping Filter:</b>
 *   // any filter that had wrapped the response should be implemented like:
 *   try
 *   {
 *     chain.doFilter(request,wrappedResponse);
 *   }
 *   finally
 *   {
 *     if (!continuation.isResponseWrapped())
 *       wrappedResponse.finish()
 *     else
 *       continuation.addContinuationListener(myCompleteListener)
 *   }
 *
 * async wait ...
 *
 * <b>Async Handler:</b>
 *   // when the async event happens
 *   continuation.getServletResponse().getOutputStream().write(process(event));
 *   continuation.complete()
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h1>Continuation Timeout</h1>
 * <p>
 * If a continuation is suspended, but neither {@link #complete()} or {@link #resume()} is
 * called during the period set by {@link #setTimeout(long)}, then the continuation will
 * expire and {@link #isExpired()} will return true. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a continuation expires, the {@link ContinuationListener#onTimeout(Continuation)}
 * method is called on any {@link ContinuationListener} that has been registered via the
 * {@link #addContinuationListener(ContinuationListener)} method. The onTimeout handlers 
 * may write a response and call {@link #complete()}. If {@link #complete()} is not called, 
 * then the container will redispatch the request as if {@link #resume()} had been called,
 * except that {@link #isExpired()} will be true and {@link #isResumed()} will be false.
 * </p>
